Learning the ropes


n the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin' four lanes
With the top down screamin' out, money ain't a thang
Bubble hard in the double R, flashing the rings
With the window cracked, holla back, money ain't a thang
Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam clean
And to hell with the price 'cause the money ain't a thang
